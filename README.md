Lucas' Ironically-named Election System. An open source STV election web-app for ballot collection and result calculation
**Now with more pretty!**

Welcome to the LIES STV Voting System developed by Lucas North.

The system is designed to support a theoretically unlimited number of candidates in a theoretically unlimited number of elections, in which a theoretically unlimited number of voters can participate. The actual limits are set by database capability ceilings.

The app is built on Laravel 5.7, but all dependencies and vendor files are included in the git repo so that users without ssh access to their server can still use it. 

After uploading all files to the server, visit URL/install to run the included install script and provide database detials. This will populate an admin user for setup. The default admin login is "admin" with password "password".
